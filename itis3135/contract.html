<h2>Contract</h2>
<p>I,<a href="introduction.html">Brianna C.R. Lewis</a>  agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2023, ITIS 3135, Web App Design and Development  
    with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
</p>
<p>
    I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will 
    not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
</p>
<p>
    I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn 
    in assignments may show as absences.
</p>
<p>
    I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view
     my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where
      I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.

</p>
