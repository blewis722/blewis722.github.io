       <h3 >Personal Background</h3>
       <ul>
        <li class="li"> I was born in Atlanta, Georgia , but I was raised in Fayetteville, North Carolina.
             I graduated with my first degree from Winston-Salem State University. After graduating, I moved to Arizona for a couple of years,
              then I moved to Raleigh, North Carolina for a couple of years then I finally moved to Charlotte. 
              </li>
        </p>

        <h3>Professional Background</h3>
        <p class="pp_background">After graduating from Winston-Salem State University I was a photographer/filmmaker  in Arizona.
             I worked for a youth sports photography company. I also created a documentary on the young homeless in Tucson, Arizona.
              When I moved back to North Carolina I worked for  Lifetouch Preschool Photography. I now work at a glasses store so if
               you have any questions about your prescription, Iâ€™m your girl.
        </p>

        <h3>Academic Background</h3>
        <p class="a_background"> B.A in Mass Communication from Winston-Salem State University
        </p>

        <h3>Background in this subject</h3>
        <p class="background">The only background I have is using the computer to edit pictures and videos using adobe.
             And obviously growing up using the computer for homework, etc. 
        </p>

        <h3>Primary Computer Platform</h3>
        <p class="primary">The primary computer I use is a macbook pro </p>

        <h3>Courses I'm in & why </h3>
        <p class="course">PSYC 1101 - General Psychology- It is a requirement since I am getting a B.A in computer science
        </p>
        <p>ITIS 3135 Web Apps Development- It is a requirement but also it sparks my interest.</p>
        
        <h3>Funny/Intersting Item </h3>
        <p class="funny">I am a true creative hence getting another B.A. I like to express myself through art whether
             that's through pictures, videos, the future websites and apps I create, or the 15 tattoos I have.
        </p>
