    <h3><a href="https://www.lingscars.com/">lingscars.com</a></h3>
    <p>This website is about leasing cars. This is a company in the UK that sells used cars. You can see who they are and what type of cars they have.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Contrast: First the website is very distracting.There is no good contrast on this website. The colors actually clash together.The colors are too bright as well</li>
        <li>Repitiion:There is something different on each part of the page.  </li>
        <li>Alignment: This website is so distracting that I'm unsure about the alignment. But I don't believe everything looks aligned. There are words that goes 
            over margins on the home page.
        </li>
        <li>Proximity:Everything seems to be pushed together. It feels like they were trying to squeeze too much on each webpage and now it looks cluttered.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a href="https://www.ruckusmarketing.com/">Ruckusmarketing.com</a></h3>
    <p>This website is about a digital agency that speciliaze in web design, app development, and branding. They show their work and the previous clients that they have 
        worked with. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Contrast:I think the contrast is great. It's subtle and not over doing it. It's the right amount of white, black and orange.</li>
        <li>Repition: Repition looks good. When I clicked through each page the menu never shifted. The header and footer remained the same on each page.</li>
        <li>Alignment:Everything seems to be aligned well.Nothing seems out of place.</li>
        <li>Proximity:The proximity looks good. There is nothing that is pushed together. It looks like they gave good margins.</li>
    </ul>
