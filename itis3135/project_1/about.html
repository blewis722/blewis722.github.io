    <h2>I'M SO EXCITED THAT YOU'RE HERE <br> AND I CANNOT WAIT TO MEET YOU!</h2>
    <p>I think it's safe to assume how muuch I love photography. But, if you havent thought
        about it, think about how much you love being cuddled up with your significant other on 
        a Friday night eating the best snacks andd watching your favorite movie of all time; multiply 
        that by ten. YES, I love it that much and weddings are like the cherry on top! What I love 
        even more than that is helping couples celebrate thier union and delivering enchanting images that 
        will last a lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>I've had the opportunity to photograph many commencement ceremonies, birthday parties, and church events
        as well as tons of portrait sessions. However, weddings always give me butterflies. The beatiful details, the people,
        and the music makes me fall in love each time.
    </p>
    <p>There’s something special about witnessing love as it’s most authentic moment. The day goes by so fast, and I am able 
        to freeze every tear, every laugh, and every kiss with just one click. But it’s truly more than that, it’s about creating 
        an experience that you and your loved ones will never forget.</p>
